# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 2 - Search in a Rotated Sorted Array - Explanation

## Logic implemented
Binary Search technique was used to locate the value within the rotated sorted array.

Additional comparison logic was applied to determine whether to continue the search in left/right portion.

## Run time complexity
The run time complexity is the same as a Binary Search, which is of O(log(n))

## Space complexity
This algorithm use in-place search which doesn't take additional space other than the input array size.

As a result, the space complexity if of O(n)
