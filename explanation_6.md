# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 6 - Unsorted Integer Array - Explanation

## Logic implemented
Maintain 2 variables for the min/max values.

Traverse the array and update the min/max value variables accordingly.

## Run time complexity
The logic completes in a single traversal, which is of O(n)

## Space complexity
In place comparison was done in this algorithm. No additional space was required.

As a result, the space complexity if of O(n).
