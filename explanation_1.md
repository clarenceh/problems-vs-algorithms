# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 1 - Finding the Square Root of an Integer - Explanation

## Logic implemented
Binary Search technique was used to locate the square root value.

## Run time complexity
The run time complexity is the same as a Binary Search, which is of O(log(n))

## Space complexity
No matter what the value is, everytime we only need to find the mid value and compare the square value with the target. So constant space is used despite of the input value.

As a result, the space complexity is of O(1)
