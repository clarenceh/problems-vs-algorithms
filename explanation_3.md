# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 3 - Rearrange Array Digits - Explanation

## Logic implemented
Firstly, heap sort was used to sort the digit array

Afterwards, traverse the sorted list and construct the 2 numbers respectively.

## Run time complexity
The run time complexity is the same as the Heap Sort algorithm, which is of O(nlog(n))
